notice how this project is started, outline what you want in a txt doc, start with a general sentence of what you want, add in features you want, them write what components you will be using (express, sequelize, etc). then write the order you want to make the components. this gives a great starting point as to what you want to make, what you will be using to make it, and the order in which you will be making it. The more you plan ahead of time the smoother the project should go, of course the more time spent planning is less time coding so there is a give and take.
